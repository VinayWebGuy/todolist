# Todo List Application Development

## Development Steps

### Project Initialization

-   **Started with Laravel:** I initiated the project by running `laravel new todolist`

### Model and Migration Setup

-   **Creating Model and Migration:** I used the Artisan command `php artisan make:model Todo -m` to generate both the model and its corresponding migration.
-   **Migration Customization:** I edited the migration file to add `todo` as a string column and `is_completed` as a boolean column to keep track of task completion.
-   **Database Migration:** Executed the migration using `php artisan migrate`, which created the `todos` table in the database with the necessary fields.

### Implementing AJAX

-   **Dynamic Interaction:** I decided to use AJAX for handling data dynamically.
-   **Task Management Functions:** I implemented functions to add, update, and delete tasks using AJAX calls.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Handling Asynchronous Requests

-   **Challenge:** Ensuring that AJAX requests properly managed the task state without causing inconsistencies in the user interface.
-   **Solution:** I meticulously tested each AJAX function, adjusted the success and error handlers, and ensured robust server-side validation and error handling to maintain a seamless user experience.

### Data Validation and Security

-   **Challenge:** Implementing effective validation to prevent invalid data submissions through forms.
-   **Solution:** I leveraged Laravel's built-in validation rules within the controller methods to ensure that only valid data was processed and stored.

## Application Setup

### Setting Up the Database

-   **Create the Database:** Before running the migration, create a new database named `todolist` in your database.

-   **Configure .env File:** Ensure your `.env` file is updated with the correct database connection settings.

-   **Run Migrations:** Execute the command `php artisan migrate` to create the necessary tables in your `todolist` database.
